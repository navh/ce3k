= Meeting with DRDC

== Fixed Scenarios
- specify all scenarios
- provide "modes" to either generate or re-play existing scenario.
- save examples of "more challenging" situations
- evaluate different algorithms in identical scenarios
- Most interested in "What approaches are best in what situations".
- We ask "What would be interesting to see?"
  - Overloaded, example, by flock of birds that are all benign.
  - Swarm of boats all appear at once.
  - _Littoral environment_ (coastal) with fleet of aircraft over horizon.

== Cost Function
- We need cost over time.
- Need to test the capacity of the radar.
- Current cost function is "per action".

== Two Speed Search Beams
- 2 search zones, one area should be faster
- in navy horizon search typically takes >50% of search time.
- If we have two overlapping sensors, they need to be mutually exclusive in their search areas.
- appended to "Backlog" as "two-speed-search"
